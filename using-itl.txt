This text file walks through the steps necessary to get work through the lab sheet on one of the computers in the ITL.

1) Download and extract the lab materials from QM+ and make note of the directory you extract the materials to.
   This will likely be something like `~/Downloads/lab-week-4`.
   
2) Open a terminal session and type `cd $DOWNLOAD_PATH` where $DOWNLOAD_PATH is the path you noted from the previous
   step. For example: `cd ~/Downloads/lab-week-4`.
   
3) Type `ls` to confirm you're in the right directory; this will show all the files in the directory.

4) Type `module load python/3.6.6`. This loads the right version of python and makes sure all the libraries we need are
   accessible. This command has no output.
   
5) To confirm the environment was properly loaded, type `python --version`. The output should say `Python 3.6.6`.

6) Type `jupyter notebook` to open a new jupyter notebook in the current directory, after a brief moment Google Chrome
   should open up with our notebook.
   
7) Double click on `week-4-jupyter.ipynb` to open the lab sheet in Jupyter and you're good to go!

8) [Optional] If you'd like to follow along with the jupyter notebook in the terminal, open a new terminal session (keep
   the jupyter session open) and follow steps 2-5. Then simply type `python` to load an interactive python shell and then
   you can follow along with the notebook.
