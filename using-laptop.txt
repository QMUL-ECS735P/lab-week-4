Follow these instructions if you want to use your own laptop instead of the ITL machines. Please note I have next to no
experience with Windows, if you're having troubles I'm happy to help but you're mostly on your own. The instructions below
will assume a Unix system (Linux/macOS) but you should be able to follow along roughly on Windows.

1) Make sure you have Python 3.6.6 installed on your laptop. There are newer versions of Python but this is the version
   we use in the ITL so it makes it easier if everyone is on the same version.
   
   It's common for Linux and macOS systems to already have Python installed. You can find out by opening a terminal session
   and typing `python --version`. 
   
   It's possible that the Python version reported will be 2.X.X. Test to see if you have Python 3 installed by typing
   `python3 --version` instead. If you do have a version of Python3, great you're good to go. If not you can get the
   installer from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/

2) You now need to install the packages we need for the labs, these are `rdflib` and `sparqlwrapper`. These are simple
   enough to install. First run `pip install rdflib==4.2.2`. NOTE: if you had to run python3 in the step above, you will
   also need to run pip3 here instead of just pip.
   
   You may get a permissions error depending on how your system is setup, if that is the case simply run the command again
   but with the `sudo` prefix. eg; `sudo pip install rdflib==4.2.2`. This will prompt for your password.
   
   Next install sparqlwrapper with `pip install SPARQLWrapper==1.8.0` (prepending `sudo` or using `pip3` where appropriate.

3) [Optional] Install jupyter notebooks through pip with the following command `pip install notebook`. That's it, you're 
   good to go!
   
4) Download and extract the lab materials from QM+ and make note of the directory you extract the materials to.
   This will likely be something like `~/Downloads/lab-week-4`.
   
5) Open a terminal session and type `cd $DOWNLOAD_PATH` where $DOWNLOAD_PATH is the path you noted from the previous
   step. For example: `cd ~/Downloads/lab-week-4`.
   
6) Type `ls` to confirm you're in the right directory; this will show all the files in the directory.

8) Type `jupyter notebook` to open a new jupyter notebook in the current directory, after a brief moment Google Chrome
   should open up with our notebook.
   
9) Double click on `week-4-jupyter.ipynb` to open the lab sheet in Jupyter and you're good to go!
